Game Name, "Gabo Card Game"
Deck,"The Gabo game is played with the full standard french deck of playing cards (54 cards), including two Jokers."
Number of Players,"3 to 10"
Game Duration,"30 up to 60 minutes"
Objective,"The aim of the game is to have the fewest points in hand. Each card's value is equal to its face value (Ace = 1, Ten/Jack/Queen = 10) except Black King = 0, Red King = 15 and Joker = -2. Points are tallied at the end of each round. When a player reaches 100 points, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins."
Special Cards - General,"A special card can be played only if it comes from the pile, not from the own hand of the player nor the discard pile"
Special Cards - Jack/Queen,"If a Jack is played, the player discarding it may swap two cards on the table, regardless of which players are involved. This allows for card swaps either between two opponents or between the player and another opponent."
Special Cards - 7,"Playing a 7 allows a player to view one of their own cards without incurring any penalty."
Special Cards - 8,"Playing a 8 allows a player to view one of the cards of any of his/her opponent without incurring any penalty."
Round Structure,"At the beginning of a round, each player is dealt 4 cards, 2 can be seen until the player do his/her first pick from the pile or the discard pile; if a player looks at any of his/her cards without the right, a penalty card is given for each card viewed. After the cards are dealt, two piles are placed at the center of the table: the draw pile (face down) containing all the remaining cards, and next to it, a discard pile (face up) formed by taking the top card from the draw pile. The round proceeds clockwise. On their turn, a player chooses whether to draw a card from the draw pile or pick the face-up card from the discard pile (the goal is to collect the lowest cards), any case this card can be seen once by the player before replacing it in his hand. When drawing, the player then decides which card in their hand to exchange in order to reveal its value. If the card is picked from the discard pile, an exchange is mandatory. After the exchange, the replaced card is placed in the discard pile. At that moment, any player who holds a card with the same number may also play that card to discard one of their cards. If a player makes a mistake (for example, playing a 5 while another player incorrectly plays an 8, thinking they have a 5), the player lets the card on the discard pile and pick two penalty card that can't be seen."
Ending a Round,"A round ends when a player think he/she has the lowest score in the game and below 5 points, and as their turn, shouts 'Gabo'. The game stops immediately."
Scoring,"At the end of each round the points are tallied. If a player shouts 'Gabo' and does not have the lowest score or more than 5 points, they receive a 20-point penalty. In the event of a tie, the player who declared 'Gabo' wins the advantage."
